## Multi Signature Wallet Contract

This smart contract demonstrated a multi signature wallet written in solidity
and tested using the *foundry framework*.

## Features
- The contract allows multiple owners to collectively control the funds in the wallet.
- Each owner is a unique address with his own private key.
- A specified number of approvals are required to execute transactions.
- Only owners can submit, approve and cancel non-executed transactions.
- If an approved contract gets cancelled by all approvers, i.e. it has 0 approvals, it is removed from the contract.

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
